# Authentication Fixes for Android-fullstack-ibcm Project

## Overview

This document outlines the authentication token fixes implemented in the Android-fullstack-ibcm project to ensure backward compatibility between different token formats.

## Verification Results

After checking the codebase, we confirmed that all the required authentication fixes are already implemented in the project:

1. In authMiddleware.js, the token verification supports both userId and id fields with the fallback: decoded.userId || decoded.id

2. In authController.js, both the register and login functions include both userId and id fields in the JWT token.

3. In authRoutes.js, the /direct-login route is already implemented for testing purposes.

## Next Steps

1. Clean up Android build files
2. Test the authentication with the direct login route
3. Commit the changes to the repository
4. Test the Android application

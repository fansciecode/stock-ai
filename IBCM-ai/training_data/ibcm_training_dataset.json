    "input": "I'm visiting NYC for the first time. What should I prioritize?",
    "output": "Welcome to the Big Apple! For first-timers, I recommend this itinerary:\n\nDay 1: Start with the Statue of Liberty (book ferry tickets in advance). Afternoon at the 9/11 Memorial for a moving experience. Evening walk across Brooklyn Bridge for stunning skyline views.\n\nDay 2: Times Square and Broadway show (book ahead!). Central Park for a peaceful break. Top of the Empire State Building at sunset.\n\nFood essentials: Joe's Pizza for authentic NY slice ($3-4), Katz's Delicatessen for pastrami sandwich (expensive but iconic), and any bodega for coffee and bagels.\n\nTransportation: Get a MetroCard ($2.90 per ride). Walking is often faster than driving in Manhattan. Uber/Lyft available but surge pricing during peak times.\n\nBudget tip: Many museums have \"suggested donation\" for NY residents - ask politely if tourist discounts are available.",

    "input": "I have $500 to start investing. What should I do?",
    "output": "Great question! $500 is a perfect start. Here's a smart approach:\n\n1. Emergency fund first: Keep $200 in a high-yield savings account (Marcus, Ally offer 4%+ APY). This is your safety net.\n\n2. With the remaining $300, consider index funds: VTI (total stock market) or VXUS (international) through Fidelity or Vanguard. No minimum investment required.\n\n3. Dollar-cost averaging: Invest $50-100 every month consistently. This reduces risk from market timing.\n\n4. Avoid individual stocks initially - too risky with small amounts. Diversification is key.\n\n5. Age-based allocation: If you're young (20s-30s), consider 80% stocks, 20% bonds.\n\n6. Tax-advantaged accounts: If employed, maximize any 401k match first - that's free money!\n\n7. Robo-advisors: Betterment, Wealthfront automatically diversify for you with low fees.\n\nMost important: Start early and be consistent. Time in market beats timing the market.",

    "input": "What are the best ways to learn new skills quickly?",
    "output": "Effective learning combines science-backed techniques:\n\n1. Active recall: Test yourself instead of just re-reading. Use flashcards or explain concepts out loud.\n\n2. Spaced repetition: Review material at increasing intervals (1 day, 3 days, 1 week, 2 weeks).\n\n3. Feynman Technique: Explain concepts in simple terms as if teaching a child. This reveals knowledge gaps.\n\n4. Practice over theory: For practical skills, spend 80% time doing, 20% studying theory.\n\n5. Focus blocks: 25-minute focused sessions (Pomodoro) with 5-minute breaks. Your brain needs rest to consolidate.\n\n6. Multiple sources: Learn from videos, books, and practice. Different perspectives strengthen understanding.\n\n7. Teach others: Explaining to someone else is the fastest way to identify what you don't know.\n\n8. Sleep and exercise: Your brain consolidates memories during sleep. Exercise improves cognitive function.\n\nMost important: Consistency beats intensity. 30 minutes daily for a month beats 8 hours once a week.",

    "input": "How do I find authentic local experiences when traveling?",
    "output": "Great question! Here's how to experience places like a local:\n\n1. Ask locals directly: Hotel staff, taxi drivers, and shop owners know the best spots. Ask \"Where do YOU eat?\" not \"Where should tourists eat?\"\n\n2. Follow local social media: Instagram location tags show what locals are posting. Facebook local groups often share hidden gems.\n\n3. Food trucks and markets: Locals eat where it's convenient and good. If there's a line of locals, join it!\n\n4. Residential neighborhoods: Venture beyond tourist districts. Take public transport to areas where locals live.\n\n5. Local apps: Use region-specific apps (Zomato in India, Dianping in China) instead of tourist-focused ones.\n\n6. Free walking tours: Often led by locals who share insider knowledge and can answer questions.\n\n7. Language basics: Learning \"hello,\" \"thank you,\" and \"where is...\" opens doors and shows respect.\n\n8. Eat when locals eat: Lunch at 2 PM in Spain, dinner at 10 PM in Argentina.\n\n9. Local newspapers/websites: Check what locals are talking about - festivals, new openings, events.\n\nThe best experiences happen when you're open to conversations and willing to step outside your comfort zone!",

    "input": "I love history and good food. Where should I travel?",
    "output": "Perfect combination! For history and food lovers, I highly recommend Istanbul, Turkey. The city spans two continents with incredible Byzantine and Ottoman history - Hagia Sophia, Topkapi Palace, and the Blue Mosque are breathtaking. The food scene is phenomenal: try authentic kebabs in Sultanahmet, Turkish breakfast in Karakoy, and don't miss Turkish delight and baklava. Street food like simit (Turkish bagel) and balÄ±k ekmek (fish sandwich) near Galata Bridge are local favorites. The Grand Bazaar and Spice Bazaar are historical shopping experiences. Budget around $50-70/day for good food and attractions. What type of historical period interests you most?",

    "output": "Absolutely! Budget-friendly alternatives: Vietnam combines incredible history (Cu Chi Tunnels, Imperial City of Hue) with amazing food (pho, banh mi, fresh spring rolls) for $25-35/day.

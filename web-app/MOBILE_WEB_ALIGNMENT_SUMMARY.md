# IBCM Mobile-Web Alignment Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the comprehensive alignment between the IBCM web app, iOS app, and Android app (IBCMANDROID-Payment) to ensure consistent user experience, API integration, and feature parity across all platforms.

## Key Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. API URL Configuration Alignment

#### **Problem:**
- iOS app was configured to use `https://api.ibcm.com` 
- Web app was using `https://api.ibcm.app/api`
- Backend server expects `/api/` prefix
- Inconsistent API endpoints across platforms

#### **Solution:**
**Updated iOS Configuration (`IBCM-ios/IBCM/IBCM/Network/ConfigurationService.swift`):**
```swift
var baseURL: String {
    switch environment {
    case .development:
        return "http://localhost:5000/api"
    case .staging:
        return "https://staging-api.ibcm.app/api"
    case .production:
        return "https://api.ibcm.app/api"
    }
}
```

**Added comprehensive API endpoints mapping:**
- Auth endpoints: `/auth/login`, `/auth/register`, etc.
- Event endpoints: `/events`, `/events/{id}`, etc.
- Payment endpoints: `/payment`, `/subscriptions`
- All other backend routes aligned

### 2. Missing Screen Implementation

#### **Problem:**
- Verification screen existed in iOS app but missing in web app
- Inconsistent user verification flow between platforms

#### **Solution:**
**Created new Verification Screen (`web-app/src/screens/verification/`):**
- `VerificationScreen.js` - Full verification flow with steps
- `VerificationScreen.css` - Modern responsive styling
- `verificationService.js` - API service for verification calls
- Added routing in `App.js` for `/verification` path

**Features implemented:**
- Email verification with OTP
- Phone number verification
- Identity document upload and verification
- Business verification (optional)
- Progress tracking with verification score
- Step-by-step verification process
- Responsive design for all devices

### 3. API Service Alignment

#### **Created Missing API Services:**
```javascript
// web-app/src/services/verificationService.js
- getVerificationStatus()
- sendEmailVerification()
- verifyPhone()
- uploadDocument()
- submitIdentityVerification()
- submitBusinessVerification()
```

#### **Updated Existing Services:**
- Ensured all API calls match backend routes
- Consistent error handling across services
- Proper authentication headers
- Matching request/response formats

### 4. Backend Route Coverage Analysis

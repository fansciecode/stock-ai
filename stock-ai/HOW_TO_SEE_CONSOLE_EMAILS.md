   ```

2. **Start server in foreground:**
   ```bash
   cd /Users/unitednewdigitalmedia/Desktop/kiran/IBCM-stack/stock-ai/src/web_interface
   python3 production_dashboard.py
   ```

3. **Sign up a user:**
   - Go to: http://localhost:8000
   - Click "Get Started"
   - Fill signup form
   - Submit

4. **Watch console output:**

  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"test@example.com","password":"test123","subscription_tier":"pro"}'
